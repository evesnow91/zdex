## Run with Scilla Compiler (Docker)

### Typechecking

Start Docker.

The first time you typecheck, from the Scilla root folder, run:
```
docker build -t scilla .
```

From then on, from the ZDEX root folder, to typecheck the ZDExchange contract, run:
```
. typecheck.bash
```

To typecheck the FungibleToken contract, run:
```
. typecheck_token.bash
```

```
cd tests
node deploy.js -1
```
